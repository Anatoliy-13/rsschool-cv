About me

Gaining experience, working first as an ordinary engineer, salesman, regional manager, deputy director, I always wanted something new, interesting, to keep up with the times.
My commitment to continuous improvement and learning led me to the IT industry.
I like to study and learn something new. I love to work and see the result of my work.
I would really like to participate in interesting interactive projects with a cool team.
My ambition will help me become an experienced Frontend developer.
